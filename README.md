# Landing-Page

The project presents a basic portfolio land-page, which I got to build for Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. In here you can find about the projects I've built and my contact as well.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running you need to type the following command on your machine

```
git clone https://github.com/AnisioMandlate/Landing-Page.git
